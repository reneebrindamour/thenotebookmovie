Assignment 11: Design and Code a Responsive Website By: Renee Brindamour

Concerned about the integrity of the group, I decided to distance myself and tackle this project independently. Although this decision increased my workload, it ultimately proved beneficial for my learning progress in this course. I invested significant effort into this assignment, focusing on transitions, animations, and conducting additional research to make these elements work effectively. Throughout the process, I gained a great deal of knowledge.

I revisited my HTML and CSS code to align it with the BEM methodology. Additionally, I incorporated both flexbox and CSS Grid into my website and ran it through Lighthouse to identify any issues.

The biggest challenge I faced was with GitHub. While I appreciate the benefits of using the platform, I encountered difficulties when merging my branches; the CSS code became jumbled, and I had to reorganize it. This experience was quite an adventure as I tried to determine where each piece of code belonged. I also had to remove a few repositories before finding a more manageable approach.

Overall, I am pursuing my masterâ€™s degree because I have found something I love. Despite some bumps along the way, this assignment was truly enjoyable and provided valuable learning experiences.
